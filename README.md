# Coding Memes

This was my final (fourth) project I completed for my course. I wanted to create something fun, whilst learning mroe about React on the frontend and connecting it up to the backend where I used Ruby and Sinatra framework.

### Approach

I wanted to create a community for programmers alike. A place to share and view coding memes. The original plan was to have people create accounts and upload memes into different categories. 

I started writing a plan/flow of I wanted to do and how I was going to do it. This involved revisiting topics I had learnt weeks earlier and trying to put different parts of what I had learnt into one project.

I started with the backend and set it up with Ruby and Postgres SQL. It was quite straight forward based on a past project.

I then began with the frontend using React, we had just learnt about React. I was keen to give it a go, even though I felt I had a lot to learn. It was very challenging, but rewarding.

Two and a half days in, I realized that I probably didn't have the time to be able to create this CRUD ability in time. So I decided to change it view memes uploaded into the database, that were sorted. Due to the application becoming much simpler than I had orginally wanted, I took the opportunity to learn and understand more of React.

I also connected to a meme API, to allows vistors to create their own memes based on the templates. This was a fun feature I was able to add due to removing the CRUD feature. The only issue is, I don't have a download button and you are required to right click to be able to download the meme. And I decided to give animated background a go.
